    Expands and combines vectors to a single multidimensional array, with one

    Parameters
    ----------
    *arrays
        1D ndarrays, shapes ((N1,),(N2,),(N3,),...(Nk,))

    Returns
    -------
    *new_arrays

    ----------
    *arrays

    According to `np.linalg` broadcasting, `np.stack` combines (lists of)
    matrices into a list of matrices (as default `axis`=0).
    This function builds up the (list of) matrices from (lists of) vectors or
    scalars.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays : sequence of array_like
        Each array must have the same shape.
    axis : int, optional, default=-1
        The axis in the result array along which the input arrays are stacked.

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : ndarray
        The stacked array has one more dimension than the input arrays.
